```

### ✅ Origin UI Dependencies - Native Implementation
- **No additional dependencies added** - All components are now native HTML + React implementations
- **Kept essential supporting libraries**:
  - `class-variance-authority` - For component variants
  - `cmdk` - For Command component functionality
  - `sonner` - For toast notifications (external library)
  - `react-day-picker` - For Calendar component (already native)

## Key Design System Changes

### Styling Patterns to Implement
- **Glass Effect**: `glass-effect bg-black/5 border-0`
- **Button Variants**: `variant="glass"` (primary), `variant="minimal"` (secondary), `variant="outline"` (tertiary)
- **Color System**: Use `bg-trading-bg`, `text-muted-foreground`, Origin UI design tokens
- **Typography**: Inter font, max font-weight: 500

### Components Most Used (High Impact)
1. **Button**: Found in ~40 feature components
2. **Card**: Used for all data displays and panels
3. **Input**: Trade forms, settings, filters
4. **Dialog**: Trade entry, settings, confirmations
5. **Select**: Dropdowns throughout the app

## Migration Notes

### ✅ Breaking Changes Avoided

- **Tree Shaking**: Verify unused code is properly eliminated
- **Caching**: Leverage improved build consistency for better caching

### 3. **Developer Experience Improvements**
- **Documentation**: Update component documentation to reflect Origin UI patterns
- **Storybook**: Consider adding Storybook for component development if desired
- **Testing**: Add component tests for critical UI interactions
- **Linting**: Update ESLint rules to prefer native patterns over Radix imports

### 4. **Long-term Maintenance**
- **Monitoring**: Watch for any accessibility issues in production
- **Updates**: Keep supporting libraries (cmdk, sonner, react-day-picker) updated
- **Feedback**: Collect user feedback on UI interactions and performance
- **Innovation**: Leverage the lighter architecture for new feature development

### 5. **Optional Enhancements**
- **Custom Animations**: Add more sophisticated animations with Framer Motion if needed
- **Advanced Interactions**: Implement complex gestures or touch interactions
- **Theme System**: Expand the color system and theming capabilities
- **Component Library**: Extract components into a reusable design system

## 📋 **Deployment Checklist**
- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ No console errors in development
- ✅ All critical user flows tested
